		<h1 style="color: blue">From the Lens To Life</h1>
		<p>Growing up, many different pieces of technology influenced my view of life.  From the way I viewed the world, to the way I learned about it.  Out of all the different technologies that I have encountered, the one device to really grab my interest was a basic, point-and-shoot, digital camera.  It changed everything about me.  I was able to see the world in a way that I had never been able to experience before.  This simple camera led me to finding a path in life that I had never thought about before I came across this device.</p>
		<p>I moved into my mother’s fiancé’s house my sophomore year of high school.  He had a digital camera that he would let me borrow on occasion.  I decided to use the camera to experiment with outdoor photography.  I would find myself wandering our neighborhood for hours, seeing the world in a whole new, artistic way.  I would disappear for hours photographing the fascinating world around me.  My particular interest was in macro photography, in which I would take close-ups of flowers, bugs, and various other interesting things I would find.  My favorite thing to do was to wait for after a storm to photograph the flowers around the house.  The way the droplets sparkle on the bright petals is still one of the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed.</p> 
		<p>Once my love for photography was noticed, I was given my own point-and-shoot camera for Christmas.  It was a bright blue and extremely shiny.  I was very excited to receive my own camera and to be able to create beautiful photography whenever I wanted.  The majority of my Christmas was spent outside, using my new camera.  I remember capturing the gentle grace of the glittering snow around me.  I captured the way the shadows fell over the icy environment and the shine of the hanging icicles.</p>
		<p>The summer after I received my new camera, I spent every day outside taking more pictures than I could practically deal with.  I would come home with five hundred different shots to upload to the computer.  I had to spend a lot of time picking which ones to keep and which ones to toss.  I would toy with the camera settings to figure out which ones worked with different subjects and different lighting.  I taught myself everything that I could possible know about my little camera.</p>  
		<p>Then, I got the best gift I have ever received to this very day; a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT.  It was a “just because” gift from my grandfather.  He bought the camera for himself but decided he didn’t like it (for some reason that I cannot imagine) and decided to give it to me since I enjoyed photography so much.  I remember coming home and finding a suitcase sitting on my bed.  I opened up the metal latches to discover the camera, a different lens, a filter, lens covers, an extra battery, a charger, and a connection wire.  I was completely stunned.  I ran upstairs to ask my mom what it was for.  She explained that it was all mine and that grandpa had given it to me because he knew I had a talent for photography.  It took me a few minutes to figure out the functions of this new, complex piece of equipment, but soon enough I was producing greater photography than I ever had before.  The camera continues to produce such great quality photos that I could only dream of taking with the basic point-and-shoots.  The Canon opened the door to an even greater expansion of my photo-artistic abilities.  I moved into using people as subjects for my photography.  I have done four senior photo sessions since I received my Canon.  Like the other camera, I had taught myself the many functions and setting that the camera has to offer.  Even to this day, I am still learning new things about this special piece of technology.  Since my camera was of higher quality, I didn’t need to take as many shots to get the perfect one.  The memory on my hard-drive continues to be thankful for that.</p> 
		<p>Eventually, I broadened my skills with work in Adobe Photoshop as well.  I can add gradients, filters, and enhance different aspects of my photography to make the images pop.  I eventually was able to do things like changing hair color or making people look like they were shattering.  With a little help from Photoshop, my photography was reaching new heights in artistic beauty.</p>
		<p>That’s when I started to think about making photography a career. My love of photography, mixed with a love of writing and adventure, led me to pick a major in journalism.  This major would allow me to use all of my favorite things in one career path.  I would be able to travel the world; seeing it with my eyes and through a lens.  In fact, if I became good enough, others would also be able to see what I saw through my work.  My dream is to do a photojournalistic piece for National Geographic.  All I ask for is one piece: big or small.  I know that when I accomplish my goals and dreams, that I’ll be able to look back one day and have the little, point-and shoot camera to thank for my success and happiness.</p>
