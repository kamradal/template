			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry One: In-Class Activity 1</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the video was to show the emotional hardships of gay individuals
			from and Evangelist community.  In regards to what we are learning in WRA 110,
			it demonstrates the emotion that we should put into our writing.</p>
			<p>The video attempts to show such emotion by displaying the written words of the
			creators of the video, the grandson of the famous Evangelist.  The part of the
			video that really captures the pain and inspiration of the video is when they
			film him reading the letter out loud.  He was crying (or on the verge of tears)
			and being able to see the sadness on his face made the video very powerful.</p>
			<p>The structure of the video began with a written explanation so that you knew
			the history behind his life and his letter.  Then he read on of his favorite
			poems as a sort of uplifting relief before you heard his letter.  Next, he read
			his letter, putting us back into a sadder state.  The video ended on an inspiring
			note for those who are going through a hard time.  This ended left the viewers
			with a ray of hope.</p>
			<p>This video can help me restructure my lived experiences project by letting me
			go back and put more emotion into my writing.  I noticed that my draft talked a lot
			about the history of what led me to where I am today, but it doesn't really 
			explain how I felt or feel.  For my final draft, I will definitely be going back
			to add more emotion.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Two: Getting Over It</h1>
			<p>For some strange reason, there is an unusual amount of hormones circulating in the always "fantastically romantic" teenage air today.  It's either about how excitingly intertwined two people are, how impossible it is to ever love someone else because now you're an empty shell, OR some sort of awkward middle-ground in which you don't know what the fuck is going on (that one is me).</p>
			<p>The reason I want to vent about this is because a friend came to me complaining about how this girl is all he wants, he can't see himself being with anyone else.  I can't argue with him.  I've felt like that a time or two. And there where two really "big ones" that I thought, "No way will I ever love again after that.  There is just no way."  We've all felt it.  Like we're in some sort of movie sequence in which we are supposed to wait in sorrow until our loves come back to save us.  It happens, but on very rare and quite special occasions.</p>
			<p>I understand how my friend feels, the issue I have is that he is hopelessly unable to wake up from it all.  He cheated on her more times than I have teeth in my mouth.  He has treated her like dirt.  But now, oh now that he's a changed man, she's all he can think about.  It's sad.  Not just him, but many people, never realize what they had until it's gone.</p>
			<p>And I think that can be applied in a few different situations.  In that instance, someone didn't realize how lucky they were to have someone so amazing.  In a second, one that I think people should consider more often, is that people don't realize how much better they could have had it until they are finally out of the mess.  But no matter what the situation, I think everyone needs to wake up, and learn to move on.  He said to me, "I love her. Like really.  I know who I want.  Everything reminds me of her and it just sucks."  To which I replied,
			"You know, it's really dumb, but there have been two people I thought I would never get over. And fuck, I still think about them at least once every day. But I stopped talking to them, deleted them off my social media so I don't have to be constantly reminded of what I don't have. I got rid of their numbers so I don't feel the need to reach out to them. I push myself to be more social and meet new people. At first, it made me think of them even more, because it made me think 'God how I wish this person in front of me was them.' So then I just felt like crap. But slowly and surely, I let down my guard, and actually got to know people. I've met a couple really cool people who make me think less and less of what I've lost. Not completely, I don't know if that'll ever happen. But it sure as hell has pulled me out of the funk I was in. All I wanted to do was stay in my dorm room and cry while my roommate was out. Just because I thought I should do something just as miserable as I felt. I tell you, it's not the way to go at all."
			And knowing what I know now, I'm very happy that I made it out.  Hell, I'm extremely happy that I woke up.  My friend and I aren't even twenty.  We should never feel like our world is over because of a broken heart.  I should know first hand that love always comes back to us in the end.  Maybe not right away, and not with ease, but it does come back to us.  We all just forget that once we find someone new.  Our hearts make us feel as if it were our first love all over again.
			<p>I don't know, perhaps we're all going about it the wrong way.  What we really should start doing is dating robots.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Three: Adventure</h1>
			<p>I have a tattoo on my ribs that says that very sentence.  Truthfully, that's not all it says, but we'll talk about that some other time.  I want to talk about adventure.  The idea of being thrown into the unknown to serve every whim of a sequence of random circumstance.  There is something about that, that excites us all.  It feeds our purpose somehow.  As if we had no purpose before doing something without purpose!  And here I find myself, a young girl in college, exploring the cold and grey corners of Lansing alone.  It makes me happy, no matter how dull the city may seem to others, to go out on my own and circle through the many shops, to gaze up at the tops of the buildings.  No matter how small or large a village, town, city, I always find myself delighted to be somewhere new.  I greet the unfamiliarity around me, breathing it in, letting it allow me to smile once more.  This is something home could never make me do.  Having a home is like having a cage to me.  You are stuck there, tied to its restrictions.  Paying bill after bill for the same thing every. Single. Day.  Why not spend your money sailing across the Pacific or learning to speak French in Paris, France?</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Four: Creativity Requirements</h1>
			<p>What I require to be my most creative is to be alone.  I need to work in solitude.  I need to talk to myself and write down all my ideas.  I need to take the mess that’s inside my brain out into the real world into a solid form.  I need to write it, sketch it, paint it, mold it, type it, etc.</p>
			<p>I need to be able to take the mess and slowly untangle it to create something.  When people are around it can be very distracting.  I feel like I’m being analyzed so I hold back on my ideas.  Holding back is a great way to stunt the growth of creativity.  For me, being held back means a longer time to get things done, and sometimes missing out on things that I’ve forgotten because I haven’t been able to keep up with my brain.  Maybe it’s understandable, maybe it’s not.  All I know is,  I work way better alone in my own work space.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Five: The Social Network</h1>
			<p>I wanted to talk about the effect that technology has had on writing and communication.  With each advancement, communication becomes faster and easier.  But honestly, I feel like it becomes colder too.  People now have trouble with finding the emotion or meaning between certain things that are written.  One that gets me in trouble a lot is my sarcasm.  No one can tell when I'm being serious or funny if I type what I'm saying.  A lot of people don't type what they really want to say either.  They don't think about what they are saying or how it could be interpreted.  I feel technology has also damaged face to face communication.  It's so easy for students to type up papers, but ask them to read it out loud for the class and everything falls apart.</p>
			<p>As for writing, I feel technology has damaged that some too.  Granted, it should be improving our spelling and grammar with spell checks or auto-correct, but that only does so much.  People have to learn too.  I think that technology just does it for them so they become rusty when not using those skills.  If you can get close to an actual spelling of a word, you'll always have a computer to find the real spelling.  Instead of looking it up and learning it for yourself.</p>
			<p>With all of that said, I don't think technology is a bad thing at all.  I look forward to the advancement of our civilization and I hope we continue to make technological advances well into the future.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Six: Miserable</h1>
			<p>They (whoever the hell "they" is) say that you should write thoughts that you have out when you are frustrated.  That way you can sort them and organize them. Gah! I don't know. ANYHOW. There was recently a gentleman from my hometown who died.  He was twenty. This past October, one of my best friend's brother died.  He was also twenty.  Both of these handsome and kind gentlemen ended up taking their own lives.</p>
			<p>Here is what bothers me, people have the nerve, the audacity, to make this some kind of chance to suck some publicity out of this horrible situation.  A young boy (or idiot, if I should be so bold) felt the need to post on Facebook that suicide is a cowardly thing to do, and also very selfish.</p>
			<p>This made me so incredibly and unsettlingly angry.  So angry I feel as if a fire has been lit in my bones and will never go away.  Some small-minded prick, felt the need to stab at the pain of others just to have his "opinion" given.  Good. Good for him.  I'm sure he'll receive a gold star for that.  Why is it that people feed off of the misery of others?  I will just never understand how terrible some people can be.</p>
			<p>I recall Andrew's funeral, who was my best friend's brother.  I was never close to him.  Only talked to him once, ever.  I went to the funeral purely to support his family.  It was one of the hardest thing's I've ever done.  First was the viewing.  I came into a large room, surrounded with a hundred pictures of their only son.  All of them representing little fragments of happiness that at least got Andrew to 20.  He was smiling so wide in all of them, and I still wonder what everyone wonders, why.  Why did he feel it was time to go?  Why did he feel that no one loved him?  I hugged his sister Amanda so tightly and burst into restrained and gentle tears.  I cannot imagine the insufferable pain that it must be to bury your brother, your son, your friend. The whole event hung heavy in my heart.  Why was this effecting me so much?  I never knew him personally, but hearing all the stories of the good times everyone had shared with him and how he always, always, was there for everyone made me wish so badly that I had known him personally.  At that time, I felt guilty that I had not known Andrew before his death.  That I never stopped to take the time to be a bigger part of his life.  Saying goodbye to him was just as sad as if I had known him before his death.  The burial broke my heart.  I attended with my other best friend, Stephanie.  Her sister's boyfriend, Kyle, was Andrew's best friend. It had begun to rain as the family said their goodbyes first.  It was almost as if the skies had accepted the tears as a go ahead to pour out it's own pain.  Pressing their hands against the soaking wood coffin, Andrew's mother, father, and Amanda said their final goodbye's first.  They did not speak any words, only stood in silence.  They did not have to say anything out loud.  Andrew knew.  Andrew knew how much they loved him and how they would give anything to have him back.  They led the way back to the train of cars.  The only people left standing were Andrew's friends.  All 21 and under.  Too young to burry their buddy.  Stephanie and I were the youngest at 18.  Each of the boys placed their hands on the casket.  They also said nothing.  Just kept nodding their heads.  Then came the reality.  Andrew was not coming back.  Ever.  They began to hug each other in comfort as they could no longer hold back their despair.  I have rarely ever seen men cry, but when it occurs, it's terrible.  Kyle began to really let loose. I can't truly imagine their pain, but I can guess.  Andrew's father came back out of the car.  He embraced Kyle in such a way that words were not needed to show what level of comfort he offered.  What is it like to lose your best friend? How must it kill to know that he hid his pain from you? I don't ever want to know.</p>
			<p>That brings me back to the idiot.  If I had all the money in the world, I could confidently shake his hand as I bet everything that he has never lost a loved one to suicide, or has ever been so utterly miserable with himself that he's thought about suicide.  For one, putting that on Facebook accomplished nothing.  It won't bring anyone back, it won't make anyone feel better about themselves, but I suppose it will bring him a slew of negative attention.  Second, it makes me angry that someone could so confidently pick at his friends and family's pain.  I have seen them all beating themselves up over the fact that they didn't know.  They didn't know how truly miserable he was.  They think that maybe they were unapproachable or perhaps missed some signs.  That perhaps, they somehow played a contributing role.  Already they feel so terrible, and here this jackass is, stabbing at a someone who is dead, someone who was loved, almost literally twisting the knife in all this painful experience.  It's disturbingly pathetic.  This gentlemen may be dead.  But his is not gone.  His is in the mind and hearts of all of those who loved him so much. Those who wish more than anything that they could change the past.  It still shocks me that someone could ever have the gull to speak negatively about someone who is no longer here to defend themselves.  Next, this kid wants to say that it's selfish.  Granted, suicide leaves behind so many broken hearts, but I can't bring myself to see it as selfish.  Imagine, these people hate themselves so much and feel like there is no where to go but down.  How selfish is it that whoever runs the grand scheme of things (God, fate, destiny, physics) could not stop to help these poor people out of their depression?  How is it that the world can just chew some of us up to the point where we don't even know who we are anymore? And when we figure it out, most of us don't even like who the world has made us.  It's complete crap!  How can you sit there and say it's selfish.  If you think it was so horrible, then why don't you get off your ass and do something?  Go help someone who is need, go talk to someone who has no one to talk to, love someone who has no one to love them back.  I don't even know if I'm making any sense right now.  And then the kid can sit there and say it doesn't take courage to face death.  I don't even want to respond to that.</p>
			<p>Yes I do.  They cowards way out is to sit and rot in your own misery.  The cowards way out is to do nothing with yourself and take your misery out on others.  That's the cowards way to feel better.</p>
			<p>The whole thing just makes me sick.  I bite my tongue to the public because I know a lot of people do not have the capability to understand what it's like to be part of the darker things in life.  They do not know what it is like to truly hate themselves, to feel that death would be far better than continuing on.  They do not know what it's like to lose their best friend, their son, their brother.  And until they do, there will always be a miserable gap between those who feel and those who can't.</p>
			<p>I do feel better now.  Sort of.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Seven: A Letter Not To Be Sent</h1>
			<p>Zach,</p>
			<p>So I've thought about what I've wanted to say to you over and over again. I'd think about what I wanted to say and consider it too harsh or not harsh enough.  I thought maybe I should go all out and not hold back at all.  But I think I'm going to take the middle road...like usual.  I also considered not writing this at all.  And I plan on this being a very long letter, a chunk of my time that I will never get back.  But I really need some sort of closure, I really need to finally stand up for myself.</p>
			<p>I wanted to start from the very beginning, when I first met you working at McDonald's.  You once asked me what my first impression of you was.  I put it lightly, saying I thought you were a little bit of a nerd.  Truthfully,  I thought you were a total nerd!  You made weird, girly moaning noises over the head set all the time like some immature middle schooler.  You were (and still are) unbelievably skinny, awkward, and your pointed features made you total nerd material.  You would say the strangest things to me too.  Granted, I thought you were hilarious, but you were creepy at the same time.  The thought of dating you at the time was totally unimaginable.  If I were to tell myself back then that I would end up falling in love with you,  I would laugh my ass off in disbelief.</p>
			<p>So yes, there was a point and time where I found you completely unattractive.  Granted, the more I liked you, the more attractive you became to me.  I suppose I built you up in my head a lot.  I ignored all the things that I disliked about you because I cared about you so much, and that made me happy.  For instance, instead of opening my eyes to the fact that you are an ignorant, narrow-minded prick, I instead passed you off as strongly opinionated.  Instead of realizing that you are a rude, judgmental, inconsiderate asshole who only feels good about himself when he puts others down, I passed you off as having some sort of blunt and dark humor.  I could go on forever about how great I thought you were, but in the end I was just sadly disappointed.  To this day I wonder if maybe it was someone else that I fell in love with.</p>
			<p>You do (or did) have a few things going for you.  I used to think that you were sweet to me because you actually cared for me and cared what I thought of you.  Now I see that you are only nice to those you need something from.  Now, it seems to me that the only reason you were ever nice to me was for a girlfriend to use at your disposal.  I guess you let a lot of things that you didn't like about me go too.  When I let go of the things I didn't like, it was because I thought you deserved the chance to be loved anyway.  That's how people should love others: completely, flaws and all.  I did not let go of the things I disliked about you because I was settling for less than I thought I deserved or was desperate or whatever you would like to call it.</p> 
			<p>This is what began to ruin everything.  You stopped caring about treating me nicely.  I don't know why I let that happen for so long.  You told me over and over that you were just teasing me, but it was never okay.  That doesn't make any of what you said okay.  You have told me that I am stupid, I dress weird, I'm not funny, I'm not going anywhere in life, none of my art is any good, my writing sucks, my singing is terrible and you hate when I sing along with the radio.  Nothing about me was ever good enough for you, or at least in the end.  At first, you made me feel like I was the most beautiful girl in the whole world.  God, I was so stupidly happy.  You did a really good job at making me feel absolutely worthless though.  Hell, you're still doing a fantastic job.  I have asked myself over and over again why in the world someone would say that they loved you and then say such horrible things.  I know you said you were joking, but there is absolutely nothing funny about any of that.  I think that you had to put me down in order to make yourself feel better.  That if you put me down, you were somehow the better person in the relationship.  I think that part of you comes from what happened between you and Danielle.  You were scared of being hurt again, I get it.  I've had my fair share of being hurt by those that I love.  But you really need to move on.  She wasn't your girlfriend at the time.  You two had spilt, there was a reason for that.  You guys were afraid to move on, and when she was beginning to before you got the chance, you felt stabbed in the back.  I know she lied to you, but that's no reason to feel insecure about your future relationships.  You told me that she purposely made you look bad after that, just so she looked innocent.  Well you know what?  You've been doing the same thing to me.  You act like I've been some horrible bitch to you, like I treated you so cruelly.  I don't walk around work and say horrible things about you behind your back like you do to me.  In fact, the only time your name ever leaves my mouth is when I'm telling people how angry you make me.  It's really pathetic and I honestly feel so sorry for you.  You're missing something in your life.  You fail to see all the truly great qualities you have and instead either act like a total dick or blame everyone else for causing your unhappiness.  Find another way to build yourself up besides making others feel like trash.</p>
			<p>I really did try to make you happy, but nothing was ever good enough.  You know, I may have had my faults and I didn't always handle things the right way, but at least I tried.  You were too stupid to notice and too much of a coward to try yourself.  Everything was always centered around trying to please you.  At first, I thought I really was a failure, but now I see I was going about it the wrong way.  You do not want someone to care about you, someone you can tell anything to, someone you can be yourself around.  You want someone with money, a nice car, someone to bring you social status.  Someone who goes to school with you so you can constantly have them in your control.  Good fucking luck.  Considering your past, I would have pegged you for a little more humble than you actually are, but no, you're just a spoiled brat who is almost 18 and still can't do his own laundry.</p>
			<p>You could be a really cool person to be around if you really wanted to.  You complain about sitting at home with Molly on the weekend all the time.  Did you ever think that maybe more people would want to be around you if you weren't such a jerk?  I mean, there was a time when Paul would complain to me about you and Joey ragging on him all the time about girls.  You would always talk negatively about Joey too.  Or there was the time when you went behind Chucky's back with the whole Sam situation.  What makes me really sick is how you treat your family.  Not so much your dad but you are so snotty to your mom and you are such an ass to your brother.  You would think that because he is your family that you would be more understanding and kind toward his situation.  But instead you treat him like an annoyance.  I'm sure he does get on your nerves sometimes, but you put him down all the time, you constantly criticize every little thing that he does.  You act like he's so embarrassing too.  So what if he wants to gulp down his pop? Who cares?  I will never understand why you have issues like with just simply being nice to others.  Hell, you were so insecure that you would flirt with other girls behind my back, but if I talked to anything with a penis it was such a huge betrayal.  You lack such basic knowledge about how to truly care for someone else that I think your best bet in life is to marry a mirror.  You can't even share the radio, how are you supposed to share your life with someone else?</p>
			<p>Honestly, nothing I could possibly say to you will change your attitude or behavior.  You're probably going to laugh all of this off or act like I'm such a horrible person for finally saying what I've wanted to for so long.  Whatever helps you feel better about yourself I guess.  This has only begun to alleviate my frustration towards you.  I still can't understand so many things about your behavior.  And you know, I could call you all the names in the world and it still would never make me feel better about any of this.  I don't know how you can do it or why it helps you.  See, unlike you, I actually enjoy being genuinely nice to people.  I don't like making or even trying to make someone feel bad about themselves.  Though, I'm sure I won't have to worry about it with you.  All I want is some peace.  I'm sick of feeling like a nervous wreck before I go into work because I know I have to endure being around you.  Which reminds me, I am not your girlfriend anymore, you don't need to continue to put me down OR touch my ass.  You really need to put the past behind you and move on.  It's sad too because I really wanted us to still be friends, but you're so obsessed with making me as miserable as you are that it's impossible.</p>
			<p>I think the most disappointing thing about all of this, is the fact that I know you are a much better person than what your actions portray.  And yet, for some inconceivable reason, I feel like I only have myself to blame for all of this hopeless mess.</p>

			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Eight: MSU Symphony Orchestra</h1>
			<p>I got to see the MSU Symphony Orchestra.  They were fantastic!  I've always had a connection with music.  I've been in band since the 6th grade (though, I've never been exceptionally talented with any particular instrument).  The director kept things light and refreshing, which to me, really makes a show.  He made us laugh in-between pieces and pointed out things that an audience may not notice on their own.  And with the tremendous talent of all the members, this made for a very excellent show!
			You know, lot of kids may not go to shows like this, and may be more concerned with getting trashed on a Friday night, but I think kids should go to things like this.  It allows you to grow as a person and learn more about the world beyond what happens in our every day life.  To me, that's pretty cool.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Nine: Inside A Box</h1>
			<p>I saw this and I immediately loved it. I thought it was a really neat look at life. We should spend our lives being and thinking "outside of the box" because in death, we will spend all our time in a box. It's a sad thought, but very encouraging as well.</p>
			<p>When I find quotes like this, that push me to different (or myself to be more accurate) I like to print them off and hang them around my room. I want to be able to look at them every day and never forget, to constantly be inspired. I was even thinking about posting a few in random places where others could see them. Everyone needs that little extra inspiration.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Ten: Advertisement</h1>
			<p>I loved this advertisement.  It was really good...no...awesome.</p>
			<p>First thing that I loved about this was the narrator.  His voice was deep and strong which added to the point that he was making.  He talked about how "the hottest fires make the strongest steel."  It just fit perfectly to show the strength of Detroit and the cars that it produces</p>
			<p>The next thing that I loved about this commercial was the imagery used of Detroit.  The shots that really helped were the shots of the statues.  Muscular figures, the giant fist.  It fit perfectly with the theme of strength and with what the narrator was saying.</p>
			<p>Another thing that I loved was the inclusion of Eminem.  He is a perfect example of someone who has suffered through the "hell" of Detroit and made it out on top of the world.  To me and many others, he represents a certain kind of hero.  Not because he's saved anyone, but because he's never given up.  It's because he's fought for his success through the most incredible odds. So as far as the ad goes, he's a perfect representation of what Detroit can do.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Eleven: NyQuil Dreams</h1>
			<p>So...I am sick.  And because I am sick and taking NyQuil, I am having very strange dreams.  This is the first dream.</p>
			<p>I was walking down a street in Millington, Michigan sometime in the middle of the night.  I had heard that the middle school was no longer used and my odd fascination for abandoned buildings drew me to it.  When I came upon the school, the fields of grass around the area had all been fenced in.  A tumble-weed blew across the street in front of the school (yes, that really did happen).  I made my way around to the back of the building to look for a point of entry.  When I came around the corner, there was a clown with a flashlight, standing in the grass.  I screamed and he began to walk towards me, removing his mask.  It was a janitor that used to work at the school.  He grabbed my hand a took me to an underground bunker that he had been staying in.  It didn't have a lot to it.  It was just dirty cement with two white, plastic outdoor chairs and an ash tray full of cigarettes.  There were two tiny windows to one wall up towards the ceiling of the bunker.  Another man shined his flashlight into the windows.  From what I could tell, he was just like the other janitor, dressed in a clown suit, carrying a flashlight, but he did not have a mask on.  He kept looking in the windows as if he were searching for something.  I hid below the windows so he couldn't see me.  The first janitor looked at me and said, "Let him see you."  So I stepped out from my place and looked out the windows.  The second janitor stopped, and left the window.  In a few moments he came into the door.  "Why am I here?" I asked. The janitors then attacked me.</p>
			<p>That's the point where I woke up.  Moral of the story: never trust janitors dressed as clowns.  You're just asking for a bad time if you do.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Twelve: NyQuil Dreams Two</h1>
			<p>This is the second dream I've had during my illness.  This one is a little more confusing than the last.</p>
			<p>From what I understood,  I had just moved into an apartment on MSU campus, but the previous owners were an elderly couple that had passed away.  They had left all their possessions with the apartment and no family cared to have any of it.  This apartment was absolutely huge, so huge, that it had a basement with so many rooms that you would get lost.  My mom dropped off three Japanese foreign exchanged students who were all siblings.  The youngest was a girl.  She was extremely timid and scared of everything around her.  She barely spoke at all.  The second oldest was a girl as well.  She was confident and seemed to be the most responsible of the three.  The eldest was a boy, he was the rebel child, quite clearly.  When they came in, we began to explore the place together.  When it came to the basement, the youngest girl stayed upstairs, too scared to face the basement.  The basement was filled.  There was so much left behind.  I remember finding pictures of the couple when they were young, she was Japanese and her husband an American sailor for the Navy.  I found letters that they wrote back and forth.  I also found several boxes of her jewelry.  I thought to myself, "If I move this stuff around, could their ghosts come after me?"  After that point, we came to a room that was essentially a basement kitchen.  The boy decided that now would be a good time to offer me shrooms.</p>
			<p>I had never done anything like that before in real life, but dream me decided it would be cool.  I have never seen them before either, so my mind came up with little brown mushrooms that were like the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal.</p> 
			<p>"You have to take three of them to get the real experience."  He grinned.  I looked through his box (yes, he had a box of them) to look for the smallest three, just to be safe.  I took them.  Immediately, two midgets popped up to the right of me.  They were Mexican gangsters with saggy pants, white t's, and gold chains.  I started laughing hysterically.  "Do  you guys see this or am I just tripping balls?"  I laughed.  The boy said, "Man, you're tripping balls."  His sister began to become concerned.  I said I was very thirsty she she grabbed me some water.  As she handed it to me, I looked at her worried face and felt sad.  "Guys, this is why I never smoke or drink.  I can be happy and have fun on my own.  I hate not feeling in control like this."  And as I began to drink, I became sober.  We did more walking around the basement, digging through the many things the couple left behind.  We remained silent, wondering what memories each each item we picked up possessed.</p>
			<p>And that's when I woke up.  Moral of the dream:  Don't do drugs.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Thirteen: My Art</h1>
			<p>It’s absolutely crazy how immersed and obsessed with my artworks I become once I begin a project. Especially one that that is something completely new for me. Started experimenting with my Twiggy project yesterday and haven’t stopped toying with it yet. My eyes can hardly bare looking at a computer screen anymore (hahaha…yes they can). What’s funny is, no matter how much work I put into it, no one will really understand how much work I’ve put into it. Does that make sense? You can look at any piece of work and say, “Wow, that’s beautiful.” But you will never understand it’s true beauty unless you learn to appreciate the depth of work that goes into the piece (same goes for musical arts). I do not put so much time into my works because it’s fun (even though it is), or for money (I wish), or for fame (also wish), but because they are an extension of myself. They are beautiful pieces of me that I give away to the world for others to enjoy, for however brief of a time.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Fourteen: WRA 110</h1>
			<p>Now that I am at the end of the semester for WRA 110 I can say that I have learned a few things.</p>
			<p>One, is that you should always go to class.  No matter how bad you feel that day.  It helps a lot and makes things a lot less confusing. I know this is basic knowledge, but for incoming freshmen this is something to keep in mind when going to college.  It's very easy to want to skip class, but very harmful.</p>
			<p>Second, turn things in.  You don't get as much homework as you did in highschool honestly. But that's how it becomes tricky.  Even though there are less assignments, they are worth a higher percentage of your grade.  Not turning things in will kill your grade.</p>
			<p>Lastly, always try your best.  I know it sounds dumb, but if you do it, there's no way you will ever fail a class.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color: blue">Blog Entry Fifteen: Documentary</h1>
			<p>1.	Identify the main purpose of the documentary
a.	 The documentary discussed the history of surgeries and how advanced even past surgeries where for their time.  The surgeries had a relatively high success rate.
b.	This says to modern day scientists that they may have had help from someone outside of this world. </p>
<p>2.	What claims are proposed by the documentary?
a.	Perhaps the past “medical professionals” learned their methods from something outside of our world.</p>

<p>3.	What support is provided for those claims?
a.	A circumcision thousands of years before the bible.
b.	“He descended from the sky and gave them the medical knowledge.”
c.	Sushruta one of the most skilled surgeons ever.  Way before medicine’s time, he performed cataract removal, skin graphs, and “plastic” surgeries.
d.	Bird tie between Egypt and India.  How could these ancient civilizations, thousands of miles apart, share similar stories?
e.	Brain surgeries performed all around the world.  Cut holes in the skulls.  Patients would survive and live long lives.  Knew how to avoid causing nerve damage and unaffected motor skills.
f.	Ica Stones depict a heart surgery, looks like a heart transplant.  Stones also have pictures of people looking into telescopes.  Why and how do these stones show these things when they are so ancient?
g.	 China also had a bird-man who, when ingested a special herb, could see through walls and the human body (like a CAT-scan or an x-ray).</p>

<p>4.	How is the documentary organized?
a.	It is organized geographically.  The talk about each geographical location at a time and compare the similarities of each one, even though they are so far apart.
b.	It is also organized to compare now versus then.  Medicine now versus medicine in ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>5.	What methods are used to provide information to the audience?
a.	Telling the audience and showing the audience.</p>

<p>6.	What conclusions can you draw about the genre of the documentary?
a.	I would say that the genre of the documentary is theory or mystery.  Yes, there are facts in it, but what is uncertain is the reason behind certain historical occurances.  What I figure is, the mysteries behind the events in this documentary won't ever be solved unless we receive new, indisputable evidence that aliens were behind things.</p>
