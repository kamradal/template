			<p>The purpose of the video was to show the emotional hardships of gay individuals
			from and Evangelist community.  In regards to what we are learning in WRA 110,
			it demonstrates the emotion that we should put into our writing.</p>
			<p>The video attempts to show such emotion by displaying the written words of the
			creators of the video, the grandson of the famous Evangelist.  The part of the
			video that really captures the pain and inspiration of the video is when they
			film him reading the letter out loud.  He was crying (or on the verge of tears)
			and being able to see the sadness on his face made the video very powerful.</p>
			<p>The structure of the video began with a written explanation so that you knew
			the history behind his life and his letter.  Then he read on of his favorite
			poems as a sort of uplifting relief before you heard his letter.  Next, he read
			his letter, putting us back into a sadder state.  The video ended on an inspiring
			note for those who are going through a hard time.  This ended left the viewers
			with a ray of hope.</p>
			<p>This video can help me restructure my lived experiences project by letting me
			go back and put more emotion into my writing.  I noticed that my draft talked a lot
			about the history of what led me to where I am today, but it doesn't really 
			explain how I felt or feel.  For my final draft, I will definitely be going back
			to add more emotion.</p>
